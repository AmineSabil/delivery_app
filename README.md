# Delivery_App

This application aims to determine the tour between pickup and delivery for a driver. 

It implements the Dijkstra algorithm and the Travelling Sellman Problem.

The objective of the PLD Agile is to develop an application that calculates an optimised delivery tour from a list of requests, each composed of a pickup stop and a delivery stop.

To realise this application, we have decided to code using Java and Swing. We also applied an Agile development method and used various design patterns.

An XML File containing your map will be requiered, you can use one of the maps provided.

To load requests an XML File will also be requiered, you can use one of the XML Files provided.


## Building the app : 

 First `git clone https://github.com/AmineSabil/delivery_app.git`

Then cd into the project and open the poject on your ide. It's a maven project build on Eclipse.
